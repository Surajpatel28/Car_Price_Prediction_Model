# Car Price Prediction Model

This project uses machine learning to predict the selling price of a used car based on various features, such as the car's year, mileage, fuel type, seller type, transmission, and the number of previous owners. A **Linear Regression** model is used to analyze the relationship between these features and the car's price.

## Project Structure

```
├── dataset.csv               # Dataset of car features and selling prices
├── car_price_prediction.py   # Python script for the car price prediction model
├── README.md                 # Project description
└── requirements.txt          # Required Python libraries
```

## Features

The following features are used to predict the car price:

- **Year**: The manufacturing year of the car.
- **Present_Price**: The current market price of the car.
- **Kms_Driven**: The total kilometers driven by the car.
- **Fuel_Type**: Type of fuel (Petrol, Diesel, CNG).
- **Seller_Type**: Type of seller (Dealer, Individual).
- **Transmission**: Type of transmission (Manual, Automatic).
- **Owner**: Number of previous owners.

## Requirements

To run the project, you will need the following Python libraries:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn

Install the required dependencies using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/car-price-prediction.git
    ```

2. Make sure you have the dataset (`dataset.csv`) ready.
   
3. Run the Python script `car_price_prediction.py` to train and test the model:

    ```bash
    python car_price_prediction.py
    ```

4. The model will output the predicted prices for new cars based on the provided features.

## Results

The model will display an R-squared error value, which represents the accuracy of the predictions. Additionally, scatter plots comparing predicted prices with actual prices (or features like year) will be displayed.

## Future Work

- Explore other machine learning algorithms like Random Forest or Gradient Boosting for better accuracy.
- Implement feature scaling to improve model performance.
- Add a user interface to input car details and get predictions.

### Notes:
- Replace `your-username` in the `git clone` command with your GitHub username.
- Include any additional files or directories that are part of your project.
- Add the actual dataset to your repository or mention how to access it if it's hosted elsewhere.
